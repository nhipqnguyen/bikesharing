# Project Overview
Our assignment is to use Tableau to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data for a bike trip analysis to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Our analysis will answer the following questions:

## Resources
- Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, converted_citibike.csv.

## Results
- Below are the visulizations and their analyses:

## Summary
- Biking sharing was much more popular among male users than female users in New York City.
- More users choose to subscribe to the bike-sharing service rather than to rent short-term. In addition, the most common times to use the service were 7-9 a.m. and 5-7 p.m., which were the rush hours when most people commuted to and from work. This implies that most of the users were locals who used bikes as their main means of trasportation and not tourists.
- Most users' trips were shorter than 24 minutes. The most common trip durations were 3-7 minutes. This aligns with the fact that most users dropped off their bike not too far away from where they picked it up.
- The most frequent users were in the age range of 30 - 50, who were likely to be professional workers with stable incomes whose workplaces were close to their houses.
- On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, people were more likely to use bike-sharing service. Women tended not to rent a bike on the weekend while men did. This could mean that New York men, beside commuting for school/ work during the week, also took on biking as a recreational activity on the weekend. We should consider offering deals and/or discounts on Wednesdays when the number of users is the lowest in the week.
- In conclusions, bike-sharing service in New York City's demand was quite high with 2,344,224 trips in August, 2019. We also know our who the main targets were and their habits. This being said, we could use this useful information to customize a feasible business plan for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.
- 2 additional visualizations are the above "Trips by Age" and the following "Bike Usage":

  Looking at this graph, we can tell which bikes were used more often than others and decide on the repairing/ utilizing plan accordingly.
